    <p>Jose Rizal's journey of learning took him from his early schooling in Calamba to universities in Europe. He began his formal education at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila and later continued his studies at the University of Santo Tomas.</p>
    <p>Rizal's pursuit of knowledge extended overseas, where he studied medicine at the Universidad Central de Madrid and later engaged in further studies in Paris, Heidelberg, and Berlin. His academic adventures broadened his understanding of diverse disciplines, fueling his passion for reforms and enlightenment.</p>
